            <p>This is the story of the <a href="#">Dead Fucker</a>, a doomed individual whom nobody cares for. He's dead as fuck, with the rest of the world, which is where he is wrong. He still lives, has done things, had a full life. He just doesn't get it. Not that he's complaining, he wasn't there when the decision was taken. He's just got a bit of a mong on this one.</p>

            <p>This is one of my earliest pieces, when I was still going to art school. I made that one out of love for the Fucking Dead series, something that I still think is brilliant.</p>

            <p>Also, I'm getting a little excited about making more stuff for my Dead Fucker project, but also I've started making some other work, and am thinking of using the Dead Fucker for something else.</p>
