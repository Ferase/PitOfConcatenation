            <h3>Where does the community focus their attention?</h3>
            <p>The community has found many games that exemplify how they want to help others, as there are many games nowadays that result from single developers and contain music that’s well worth the analysis. Even somewhat obscure things can catch the attention of a VGM analyst, as the broad spectrum of video game music offers a lot of opportunities to learn and grow even without immediately analyzing it. Here’s just a few that have garnered a high reputation in the community.</p>

                <h2>Undetale &amp; Deltarune</h2>
                <h3>By Toby Fox, 2015-present</h3>
                <p>Since it’s release in 2015, Toby Fox’s Undertale has become a staple in popular culture for its compelling concept, personality, and charm, and its successor, Deltarune, is shaping up to have a similar effect. One of the most notable things about these games for many, however, are their soundtracks. Nearly all the songs in the entirety of both games are made by one person, that being Fox himself. Additionally, most of the songs are made with entirely free tools, such as the soundfonts found on William Kage’s site above. These games gave so much inspiration to the community that there are whole sample lists dedicated to them, and many people use these resources to inspire others by giving them more clear access to these guides and tools. From the soundtracks’ successes and the ease that surrounds the process of getting the tools that were used to make them make Undertale and Deltarune a great place for any musician to start when looking for what they need to begin.</p><br>
                
                <h2>The Touhou Project</h2>
                <h3>By Jun'ya Ota / ZUN, 1996-present</h3>
                <p>The Touhou Project is a series of shoot-em-up games that was first started back in 1996 and is still receiving sequels even to this day. Jun’ya Ota, better known by his moniker ZUN, is the sole developer, artist, and composer of his games, much like Toby Fox. The music of the Touhou series has changed with time, beginning as chiptune and later evolving to use mixtures of Roland samples and other virtual instruments. Attention from the VGM Analysis community arose around these games and their soundtracks because of what they were composed with, which as previously mentioned were predominantly Roland digital instruments. This as well as the popularization of the Romantic Trumpet samples is what cemented this series into the community’s interest and made it an inspiration for some VGM composers.</p>
