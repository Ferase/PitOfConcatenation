            <h3>Where does the community focus their attention?</h3>
            <p>The community has found many games that exemplify how they want to help others, as there are many games nowadays that result from single developers and contain music that’s well worth the analysis. Even somewhat obscure things can catch the attention of a VGM analyst, as the broad spectrum of video game music offers a lot of opportunities to learn and grow even without immediately analyzing it. Here’s just a few that have garnered a high reputation in the community.</p>

                <h2>Undetale &amp; Deltarune</h2>
                <h3>By Toby Fox, 2015-present</h3>
                <p>Since its release in 2015, Toby Fox’s Undertale has become a staple in popular culture for its compelling concept, personality, and charm, and its successor, Deltarune, is shaping up to have a similar effect. One of the most notable things about these games for many, however, are their soundtracks. Nearly all the songs in the entirety of both games are made by one person, that being Fox himself. Additionally, most of the songs are made with entirely free tools, such as the soundfonts found on William Kage’s site above. There also exist a variety of sample lists for Undertale, Deltarune, and other works by Toby Fox. The first ever made by the community was a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZFusgT_6ROaajy9HkHrauSJY9vC7qP7oeEeYchPs2PE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">sample list for only Undertale</a> back in 2016, and as new information was found and as Fox released more games, the community created a much more <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pGui7CC3PxoYRXinHgECjmbvRK6oihGv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101913200579244759366&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">accurate and comprehensive sample list</a>. Others exist as well, and the abundance of them shows how important this game was to this community and speaks to how helpful it was and is to those interested in music production.</p><br>
                
                <h2>The Touhou Project</h2>
                <h3>By Jun'ya Ota / ZUN, 1996-present</h3>
                <p>The Touhou Project is a series of shoot-em-up games that was first started back in 1996 and is still receiving sequels even to this day. Jun’ya Ota, better known by his moniker ZUN, is the sole developer, artist, and composer of his games, much like Toby Fox. The music of the Touhou series has changed with time, beginning as chiptune and later evolving to use mixtures of Roland samples and other virtual instruments. Attention from the VGM Analysis community arose around these games and their soundtracks because of what they were composed with, which as previously mentioned were predominantly Roland digital instruments. This as well as the popularization of the Romantic Trumpet samples is what cemented this series into the community’s interest and made it an inspiration for some VGM composers.</p><br>
                
                <h2>Doki Doki Literature Club</h2>
                <h3>By Dan Salvato, 2017</h3>
                <p>Just by the title, the game doesn’t sound too terribly interesting or unique, and this is the impression one would continue to have if they began playing it themselves. Surprisingly however, this game is a psychological horror experience disguised as a safe and harmless visual novel. The game was also developed by one person, Dan Salvato, who also wrote the story and composed the music. Because of the subversion of expectations and the mostly solo development, the game garnered a lot of attention from multitudes of gaming communities, a small contingency of which being those from the VGM Analysis community. It was found that mostly a single instrument pack for a rather popular software plugin called Nexus was used to make all the music in the game. While interest in the music of this game wasn’t as high as Undertale or the Touhou Project, it caught people’s attention and even spawned a dedicated <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1islBhV5rZfV618lvjhEb7KxQvFToVdJVrHHniVkW_Jc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">sample list</a>.</p>
