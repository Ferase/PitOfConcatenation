            <p class="left">Music has evolved to be something that can accompany almost anything if the creator works intently enough with it. Despite this wide angle lens, many believe that they need big, expensive software and hardware to create music, and although this can be true for certain areas of the industry, this is certainly not the case in all others. How? Video game music.</p>

            <h2>Who Are They?</h2>
            
            <p>The VGM Analysis community is a group that focuses on identifying the tactics and tools used by musicians within their works in video games. A lot of video games nowadays typically use digitally-composed music, and a good portion of the time, the digital instruments and effects used in these tracks can be traced back to whatever plugins, VSTs, sound canvases, or other sample libraries the composers used to create them. This what this community thrives on, as their goal is to pull together these resources and provide musicians looking for digital instruments a place to find some completely free and visibly powerful tools to get them going. Although they are primarily focused on VGM, their experience and trained ears often result in them identifying tools used in the music for films, TV shows, ads, and other media simply by audio memory alone.</p>
            
            
            <h2>Their Goal</h2>

            <p>As previously mentioned, the VGM Analysis community thrives on taking video game music and deciphering the audio to identify the tools used to make it for any other musician’s reference. Some of the time, these tools and plugins they find are paid, but there’s a vast amount of games that use free libraries, usually soundfonts or other VSTs, that anyone can download and use. Moreover, because they are being identified through music in which they’ve been used, the music itself acts as a specimen of the potential power of these free tools and, therefore, the capability to make good music with such tools.</p>
