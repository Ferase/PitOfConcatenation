            <h3>Well, who are we?</h3>
            <p>In short, the VGM Analysis community is a vast collection of different people with a mutual love for music and video games. Those within the community will research and source the sounds and samples used in video game music and publicize knowledge of the tools or information they found so that it may help other digital musicians in the future. That’s all pretty self-explanatory, but what are the more intricate details of the community? What’s their history? Why video games? That will all be answered right here!</p>

				<h2>Video Games</h2>
                <h3>Can't be video game music without video games</h3>
                <p>Countless games, even those of today, use digital sounds and samples to make up the instruments within their songs, and because of this fact, it becomes possible to research and source these sounds, be them sampled or synthesized. In doing this, the VGM Analysis community can not only trace back the sources of certain sounds and digital instruments, but they can also provide them as tools to other aspiring musicians.</p><br>

                <h2>Methods of Sharing</h2>
                <h3>A good way to help others is by sharing knowledge</h3>
                <p>So, if information about a game and its music are collected, where are they shared? The most common way of sharing information about video game music is through online digital records. These can be Google or Microsoft spreadsheets or word documents, full webpages or websites, Community forums and servers, or really any sharable online medium. The most common digital records to find are called sample lists, and they typically contain some or all sources for the samples and sounds used in a single video game or game series. There even exist some that compile other sample lists together, and others that go on to list hundreds of games and the sources to their audio.</p><br>

                <h2>Doing it Together</h2>
                <h3>A community isn't a community without teamwork</h3>
                <p>The process to operating in the VGM Analysis community varies from person to person, but the surefire thing to note about it first and foremost is that the community thrives on teamwork. Everyone comes from different backgrounds, different experiences, but most significantly, everyone has worked with and heard different things. Sourcing something could take a long time, especially if all you have to work with is a sound file, but with a full community of sleuths who all search for sources for countless sounds and samples, there’s a good chance someone among you might know something that could help, and they’re merely a message away. This is why sharing and teamwork is so important, because with games and the internet as a whole being so broad and vast, the best and most reliable search engines might just be your peers.</p>
