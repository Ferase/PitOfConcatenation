            <h3>How do we analyze video game music?</h3>
            <p>In short, the VGM Analysis community is a vast collection of different people with a mutual love for music and video games. Those within the community will research and source the sounds and samples used in video game music and publicize knowledge of the tools or information they found so that it may help other digital musicians in the future. That’s all pretty self-explanatory, but what are the more intricate details of the community? What’s their history? Why video games? That will all be answered right here!</p>

                <h2>Frequency Cancellation</h2><br>
                <p>When a song is loaded to the brim with instruments and other sounds, it can be hard to decipher what exactly is going on in the more intricate levels. Using frequency cancellation, we can extract layers of some songs to remove vocals, instruments, noise, and other audio information from songs that have a wide range of frequencies present throughout.</p><br>
                <h3>For a quick demonstration of how this works and how you can do it yourself, here’s a quick video that explains frequency cancellation in more detail and describes how you can do it yourself.</h3>

                <h2>Spectrogram Analysis</h2><br>
                <p>A spectrogram is a visual representation of the frequencies of any given audio, and they are often very helpful in deciphering some of the notes of a song. This is most effective when the song is soft or has few instruments. The way a spectrogram communicates the pitches and frequencies of a sound to an analyst is by providing somewhat of a visual reference for where the notes would appear in a horizontal piano roll.</p><br>
                <h3>Take a look at this example using a snippet of Toby Fox’s “Fallen Down” as the base audio.</h3><br>

                <h2>Using a Keyboard</h2><br>
                <p>This one might be a bit on the nose and also not as easy for people who aren’t good at differentiating notes by pitch alone, but this is a super important thing to practice in any aspiring musician’s cycle of learning. When it comes to piecing together how a song works, it’s important to understand the flow and composition of the melody and its supporting factors. Using a piano or MIDI keyboard to attempt to somewhat transcribe the music into your own muscle memory will not only build skill towards actual piano playing, but it will also help you find patterns within the music that can train you to look for patterns elsewhere and even in your own works. While this is more of learning tip than a method of analysis, it still warrants some focus since it’s both important and typically not too difficult for someone to be able to begin playing piano and learning about the mechanics of music that way.</p>
