            <h3>Where do the spoils live?</h3>
            <p>It’s pretty obvious now that the goal of the VGM Analysis community is to provide musicians with tools, resources, and knowledge for composing music using video game music as the reservoir. There are heaps of content that the community has produced, some being troves of juicy information and others being actual utilities that can be used and applied to one’s works. Here’s a few that will give you a good taste of what comes out of the VGM Analysis community.</p>

                <h2>The Sound Sources List</h2><br>
                <p>As a group dedicated to sourcing sounds, samples, tools, and information about video game music, the VGM Analysis community, there have to be places in which to output this information for others to easily view and reference. These are often done by creating online spreadsheets and word documents, and although these often focus on singular games, there are a select few that contain more. One of the largest of these is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JJBlHHDc65fhZmKUGLrDTLCm6rfUU83-kbuD8Y0zU0o/edit#gid=2047725819" target="_blank">VGM Sound Sources List</a>, a compendium of countless different documents compiled by the people of the community. This spreadsheet contains several links to all kinds of helpful resources, such as sample lists for certain games or consoles, breakdowns of sound libraries made by big names in the music and sound design industry, guides for using certain music programs, and so much more.</p><br>
                
                <h2>William Kage’s SNES Soundfont Library</h2><br>
                <p><a href="https://www.williamkage.com/snes_soundfonts/" target="_blank">William Kage’s SNES Soundfont</a> Library is a resource filled to the brim with soundfonts, or collections of playable virtual instruments, that contain all the instrument samples from different Super Nintendo games. The SNES era is an time of interest in the VGM Analysis community, as the console’s new sample-utilizing capabilities made it one of the first that predominantly used samples instead of chiptune tones. Thus, samples and music from the SNES became a staple in VGM compositions and as functional examples of how well these samples work under even the limitations of the consoles of the 90’s.</p>
