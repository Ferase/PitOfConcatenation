Here, you will find a trove of information about who they are, how they do what they do, what their goals are, and how the community operates as a collective whole.</p><br>

				<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
                <p>As previously stated, the VGM Analysis community is a collection of people from a wide variety of musical backgrounds who study music from video games. Some do it for the sake of practicing sound design techniques, some search these songs for sounds and digital instruments they can use for their own production, and some simply use their findings to add to their musical palette. Overall, we all connect ourselves through a mutual interest or love of video game music, and a vast majority of us have done research of our own or even collaborated to create comprehensive and resource-packed repositories for others to use and share.</p><br>
                <h3>If you would like to know more about us, check out the <a href="about.html" target="_blank">Community</a> section!</h3><br>
                
                <h2>Why Do We Do This?</h2>
                <p>There are a variety of reasons we do what we obsess over video game music, though it might not be entirely obvious at first. The short answer is that we want to provide and share both resources and understandings gathered from researching and archiving video game music and their original sources. Essentially, you can think of us as a source; we archive tools, resources, information, and other goodies that those wanting to compose digital music can use and learn from.</p><br>
                <h3>For the full scoop, check out the <a href="ventures.html" target="_blank">Ventures</a> page!</h3><br>

                <h2>Where Can We Be Found?</h2>
                <p>Frankly, if you search for VGM Analysis communities on any social media platform or even Google, you’ll find many different groups that do what we do. Even though this community technically encompasses all of those who research and make video game music, we’re not all connected; there are so many VGM Analysis groups out there, whether you’re looking on Google, Discord, or any other platform. If you’re interested, just dive in using your search engine of choice and pick a place to begin!</p><br>
