            <h1>WHERE THE HELL AM I</h1>
            <h2>The world will never know</h2>

            <p>I was a world with the weight of it's own. I lived alone inside an ivory fortress... where no one could find me. Then one fine winter I looked out at a world without walls, the world was mine. It looked for hours at a time, all around me was ice and fire, it was like I was at the center of nothing. All I could do was sit and look, as it looked. One snow flake fell, melting fast, down into another flake to make a new storm around me. My view was limited. I wanted to see more but I didn't want to lose myself in it. The world is always there, in me, and so was I.</p>

            <p>If I'm not lost I'm nowhere. If I'm nowhere then my world is as big as it can be, it is everything. But it's like I'm in another world, where I can reach from one world to the other without ever really going, but I can. So, I go to my world.</p>

            <p>What is real. Is what is possible for your mind to be. So, if it is real it is for your mind. To be lost in your own world you would have to be in another, because the mind cannot be anything more. If you had to be something more, it would be real. But if it is real it is for you mind. This is what is meant by reality. Reality is for you.</p>

This is what is meant by reality. Reality is for you.</p>

            <p>Why is it called reality if it is for your mind? It is just something you make up. It's just another one of your fantasies. But if it is only for your mind, then it's not real. So that's the crux. That's the only thing that I'm really worried about is that we're just making up these things about reality and trying to force our minds to accept this fiction.</p>
