            <h3>DAY ONE<br>
            Monday, August 31st</h3>
            <h4 class="tan">7:30am-8:55am Breakfast<br>
            8:55am-9:00am Morning Welcome</h4>

            <h4 class="tan">9:00am-10:00am</h4>
            <h4>Jeffrey Zeldman / <span class="jobTitle">A List Apart, A Book Apart, An Event Apart</span><br>
            <span class="subtitle">The Fault, Dear Brutus (or: Career Advice From a Cranky Old Man)</span></h4>

            <p>We have met the enemy, and he is us. Many of the professional problems we blame on boneheaded bosses and clueless coworkers actually come from ourselves. Identify career woes you bring on yourself, and learn to get out of your own way. Make yourself irreplaceable. For better meetings, better projects, and a better life, cultivate the professionally and emotionally healthy worker within. Plan for a long, deep career. See how improving your sales ability can make all the difference in your work and job. Employees, learn what to do when your work doesn’t reflect your best abilities. Freelancers, find out how to raise your profile and your rates. Master the side project, and use it to make deeper contacts in your community. Above all, free yourself to know (and speak) your mind. You’ll come away full of inspiring new ideas, and brimming with energy and enthusiasm for your work and the people it serves.</p>

            <h4>Jen Simmons / <span class="jobTitle">Designer</span><br>
            <span class="subtitle">Modern Layouts: Getting Out of Our Ruts</span></h4>

            <p>In the early years of the web, there was a lot of variation and experimentation with where to put content on a web page. Then, it seems, we all settled into a handful of patterns and stayed there for over a decade. It wasn’t until the arrival of responsive design that new ideas for page layout started appearing. Now with new CSS properties for layout landing in browsers, we may be about to see a bigger renaissance in layout design patterns. How can we better use the space inside the glass rectangle? What layout innovations could help users better find and focus on what they want? Take a walk through where we’ve been, where we might be going, and how we can better design for the true medium at hand. This talk features practical examples of what's newly possible, along with access to a code repo for you to play with later.</p>

            <h4 class="tan">11:30am–12:30pm</h4>

            <h4 class="tan">4:30pm-5:30pm</h4>
            <h4>Ethan Marcotte / <span class="jobTitle"> Author, Responsive Web Design</span><br>
            <span class="subtitle">Laziness in the Time of Responsive Design</span></h4>

            <p>As screens and input types evolve, we’re managing more complexity in our designs than ever before: our layouts are becoming more flexible and responsive; our interfaces, more immersive. Maybe we can look for simpler approaches? In this session, Ethan—a singularly lazy person—will walk through some responsive designs, and show how we might do a lot more with a little bit less.</p>

            <h4 class="tan">5:30pm-7:00pm</h4>
            <h4>Opening Night Happy Hour<br>
            <span class="subtitle">Sponsored by: Slack</span></h4>

            <p>If your brain isn’t completely full from the day of talks, stick around afterwards for An Event Apart’s Happy Hour featuring drinks and snacks provided by Slack, the messaging app for teams. Come meet and mingle with fellow attendees, compare notes, and relive your first fun-filled day in Chicago. Take a load off and relax–you earned it, plus it’s a perfect pre-dinner transition before you venture out into the night.</p>


            <h3>DAY TWO<br>
            Tuesday, September 1st</h3>

            <h4 class="tan">7:30am-9:00am Attendee Event Check-in/Badge Pick-up<br>
            7:30am-8:55am Breakfast<br>
            8:55am-9:00am Morning Welcome</h4>

            <h4 class="tan">9:00am-10:00am</h4>
            <h4>Matt Haughey / <span class="jobTitle">Founder, Metafilter</span><br>
            <span class="subtitle">Everyone’s in the Customer Service Business</span></h4>

            <p>No matter what your job title might say, chances are everyday you have the opportunity to improve things for the users of your sites and apps. This talk is ostensibly about empathy in design and programming but seen through the lens of customer service, a thing every company strives to do better. Matt Haughey will examine the last 15 years of projects and groups he has worked with, from a time when he never interviewed a single user of an app he helped design, all the way to the present, where user interviews, transparent support, and support days for all staff is the norm. He will show you how, even if you weren’t born dripping with empathy for others, you can practice it in your work and improve the lives of everyone who uses your products.</p>

            <h4 class="tan">10:15am-11:15am</h4>
            <h4>Val Head / <span class="jobTitle">Author, The Pocket Guide to CSS Animations</span><br>
            <span class="subtitle">Designing Meaningful Animation</span></h4>

            <p>Motion design has become a necessary skill for designing and building the modern web. The character and energy that motion brings to an interface is becoming as expected on the web as it is in other media. Great web animation comes from thinking like a motion designer and brand steward, matching the motion we add to our message and design goals. Learn key animation principles such as timing, offsets, and secondary action as they apply to interface design decisions—plus motion principles specific to designing animated interactions. Consider this your crash course on becoming a motion design pro!</p>

            <h4 class="tan">4:30pm-5:30pm</h4>
            <h4>Chris Coyier / <span class="jobTitle">Author, CSS-Tricks.com</span><br>
            <span class="subtitle">The Wonderful World of SVG</span></h4>

            <p>SVG is vector graphics for the web. But fear not, at its heart it’s just a file format, and no harder to use than JPG, PNG, or GIF. If you aren’t yet using SVG, by the end of this talk you’ll not only be anxious to start, but empowered to do amazing things with it. Things like style it with CSS, animate it with JavaScript, or use it to build out an entire icon system for your site. And you’ll know you’re doing the right thing, because you’ll learn how efficient and accessible SVG can be.</p>

            <h3>DAY THREE<br>
            Wednesday, September 2nd</h3>
