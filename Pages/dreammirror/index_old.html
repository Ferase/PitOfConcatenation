                    <h1>Amusement Parks</h1>
                    <p>Theme parks and carnivals are escapes from life into a lively, fun world, typically free from most if not all negative emotions and baggage. If one finds themselves within such a place in their dream, it could simply be a form of escapism for the dreamer. It could also potentially connect with one’s rebellious feelings if the experience happens to take place in areas restricted to the public, such as maintenance zones or inactive attractions.</p>

                    <h1>Hallways</h1>
                    <p>In and of themselves, hallways are links and transitions between other more focused and purposed spaces. Within the dream world, they often serve a near equal objective as a transitionary tool, but reflecting the dreamer instead. It’s common for those whose dreams prevalently contain hallways to be in a transitional period in their lives. While the magnitude of such events are subjective and situational, some examples of these changes are moving house, breaking habits, and choosing alternate paths in life.</p>

                    <h1>Jails</h1>
                    <p>In reality, a jail or prison is a place where criminals and people guilty of breaking the law go to serve their time for whatever they had done. Additionally, and on a more intrinsic level, jails serve as a means of barring those within from their freedom; a shackle holding them back. Most dreams wherein a jail or similar location is the setting usually revolve around this idea, symbolizing the idea that the dreamer might be being restrained by something in their life and is therefore unable to be completely free.</p>
