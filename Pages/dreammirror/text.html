    Across many cultures, <strong>flowers</strong> stand as a symbol of <strong>love or respect</strong>, and the same is true for dreams.

    Being messengers of time, <strong>clocks</strong> are the <strong>indicator for movement, progression, growth, age, decay, and countless other processes</strong>. If you focus on your time in real life and find yourself dreaming about clocks, it’s likely <strong>your habits of always watching the time are simply firing off like muscle memory within your dreams</strong>. If time isn’t a big focus in your everyday life, it could be the <strong>embodiment of an anxiety or fear</strong> that you either <strong>don’t fully think about in your waking hours</strong> or <strong>something that you aim a lot of your focus towards which consumes your time or has strict deadlines</strong>

    <strong>Chairs</strong> are things a lot of us find ourselves sitting down in when we want to <strong>work, relax, or do anything in between</strong>. Regarding only the presence of a chair in a dream, it can represent a <strong>commitment or pledge</strong>, and <strong>depending on the environment the chair is in</strong>, this implied vow <strong>could mean many possible things</strong>. If you <strong>actually sat in the chair</strong>, this could mean that <strong>you’ve taken the pledge it represents</strong>, and you’ve planted yourself there to <strong>initiate the commitment</strong> 
</p>


<!-- Feelings -->
<p id="feel_01">
    Within a dream, <strong>joy and happiness</strong> are powerful feelings that only show their true forms when one <strong>experiences something truly remarkable, mesmerizing, or meaningful to them</strong>. Feeling happy in a dream, or awakening to a feeling of happiness, most likely means that <strong>your dream experience was reminiscing something joyful that happened in the past</strong>, or possibly <strong>creating a scenario that derives from such an experience</strong>
</p>

<p id="feel_02">
    <strong>Sadness</strong> is an emotion many relate to <strong>negative events</strong>, and while there is a true connection between sadness and negativity, this emotion can also erupt from a <strong>sense of closure or departure from something sentimentally or chronically habitual</strong>.

</p>

<p id="feel_03">
    As a very powerful and dangerous emotion, <strong>anger</strong> represents <strong>negativity, frustration, and impatience</strong> towards something.

This emotion often <strong>carries over</strong> from days where you might have had <strong>a bad experience</strong> or <strong>an emotional shock</strong>
</p>

<p id="feel_04">
    The feeling of being <strong>afraid</strong> is one of the most <strong>deeply rooted</strong> emotions in nearly all creatures, <strong>especially humans</strong>. Expressing fear in a dream often stems from an <strong>actual fear or phobia one has</strong>, and can often <strong>manifest itself as a creature or person that chases you</strong> within your dream. This emotion usually conveys the idea that <strong>you are putting something off</strong> or <strong>avoiding something that you either generally fear or something that needs more immediate attention</strong>
</p>

<p id="feel_05">
    <strong>Anxiety</strong> is the <strong>ultimate embodiment of stress and chaos</strong>, standing to represent an <strong>imbalance of one’s emotional or mental state</strong> through a cavalcade of other emotions and actions. Responding to anything within a dream with feelings of anxiety can represent <strong>a loss of control over something</strong>, either <strong>within yourself</strong> or <strong>something in real life</strong>
