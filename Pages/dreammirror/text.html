<!-- Beings -->
<p id="being_01">
    If you encounter <strong>people</strong> you know within your dream, it could have a connection to your relationship with that person or your recognition of their identity. On the other hand, manifesting random people in your dreams is quite common, and usually an effect of your mind creating a familiar copy of reality
</p>

    <strong>Cats</strong> are an embodiment of the love for the feminine principle, and within a dream, they typically stand to represent its values. A cat in one’s dream can denote a sense of calmness and creativity, symbolizing patient feelings and a softspoken nature. Their association with hunting may also symbolize a desire for discovery or freedom
</p>

<p id="being_03">
    As man’s best friend, <strong>dogs</strong> represent loyalty, affection, and happiness within a dream. They also embody a strong love of the masculine principle, and therefore, the symbol of the dog has a strong tie to your overall sense of love. Thus, the actions the dog is performing may denote how you feel or express your love and affection towards others
</p>

<p id="being_04">
    When anyone thinks of a <strong>bird</strong>, they immediately gravitate towards the concept of flight. In the dream world, this could directly connect to the ideas of freedom and discovery through such a concept, however birds can sometimes exist as messengers. More specifically, in this scenario, they typically symbolize a piece of information you haven’t fully processed or may not completely understand yet
</p>

<p id="being_05">
    <strong>Lions</strong> are ferocious animals, seen by most as the absolute apex of the apex predators. Encountering such a beast within your dream usually symbolizes a kind of power or strength, particularly related to one’s confidence or empowerment. A lion could also represent an epiphany or greater understanding of a subject that is within your reach
</p>


<!-- Objects -->
<p id="obj_01">
    Across many cultures, <strong>flowers</strong> stand as a symbol of love or respect, and the same is true for dreams. If a flower is significant or memorable within a dream, its likely that it connects to some form of love or affection the person has towards something or someone. Additionally, its prevalence may be speaking as commentary to someone or something you love, or it could be a response to your overall view on love itself
</p>

<p id="obj_02">
    <strong>Books</strong> are the embodiment of knowledge, and thus, they live as a symbol for information and definition. The prevalence of books within one’s dream potentially connects to the idea that bits of information that could possibly answer a question your conscious mind has been pondering already exist within your knowledge
</p>

<p id="obj_03">
    Being messengers of time, <strong>clocks</strong> are the indicator for movement, progression, growth, age, decay, and countless other processes. If you focus on your time in real life and find yourself dreaming about clocks, it’s likely your habits of always watching the time are simply firing off like muscle memory within your dreams. If time isn’t a big focus in your everyday life, it could be the embodiment of an anxiety or fear that you either don’t fully think about in your waking hours or something that you aim a lot of your focus towards which consumes your time or has strict deadlines
</p>

<p id="obj_04">
    In general, <strong>lights and lamps</strong> are symbols of problem-solving, ideas, innovation, and of course, clarity. The goal of any light is to make clear and visible a place or an object that cannot be seen in normal conditions, and within a dream, this could be a sign of mental discovery or even epiphany towards an idea, just like a light at the end of a tunnel
</p>

<p id="obj_05">
    <strong>Chairs</strong> are things a lot of us find ourselves sitting down in when we want to work, relax, or do anything in between. Regarding only the presence of a chair in a dream, it can represent a commitment or pledge, and depending on the environment the chair is in, this implied vow could mean many possible things. If you actually sat in the chair, this could mean that you’ve taken the pledge it represents, and you’ve planted yourself there to initiate the commitment
</p>


<!-- Feelings -->
<p id="feel_01">
    Within a dream, <strong>joy and happiness</strong> are powerful feelings that only show their true forms when one experiences something truly remarkable, mesmerizing, or meaningful to them. Feeling happy in a dream, or awakening to a feeling of happiness, most likely means that your dream experience was reminiscing something joyful that happened in the past, or possibly creating a scenario that derives from such an experience
</p>

<p id="feel_02">
    <strong>Sadness</strong> is an emotion many relate to negative events, and while there is a true connection between sadness and negativity, this emotion can also erupt from a sense of closure or departure from something sentimentally or chronically habitual. Feeling sad within your dreams may mean that your unconscious mind is simulating or encoding the occurrence of a worry into your dream experience, or it could also mean that your mind has started to cope with something and has begun the process of closure
</p>

<p id="feel_03">
    As a very powerful and dangerous emotion, <strong>anger</strong> represents negativity, frustration, and impatience towards something. Feeling this emotion in your dreams could mean that your mind undertones your dreams with something that’s bothering or frustrating you in real life. This emotion often carries over from days where you might have had a bad experience or an emotional shock
</p>

<p id="feel_04">
    The feeling of being <strong>afraid</strong> is one of the most deeply rooted emotions in nearly all creatures, especially humans. Expressing fear in a dream often stems from an actual fear or phobia one has, and can often manifest itself as a creature or person that chases you within your dream. This emotion usually conveys the idea that you are putting something off or avoiding something that you either generally fear or something that needs more immediate attention
</p>

<p id="feel_05">
    <strong>Anxiety</strong> is the ultimate embodiment of stress and chaos, standing to represent an imbalance of one’s emotional or mental state through a cavalcade of other emotions and actions. Responding to anything within a dream with feelings of anxiety can represent a loss of control over something, either within yourself or something in real life
</p>
