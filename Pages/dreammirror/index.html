                <h1>Set the Stage of Your Dream</h1>
            </header>
            <main class="landingSect">
                <p>At the foundation of all of our experiences are the places we have them in. Thus, it’s common for our minds to generate new experiences housed within or around the environments we’ve come to be so familiar with in our daily lives. Just like a story, the setting of a particular event in a dream can determine the framework of the dream itself. The locations themselves may bear meanings of their own, however additional mean can arise through the other elements present within the setting of the dream.<br><br>

                From the objects and beings to the emotions and concepts, this vast world of dreams and their potential meanings can change and fluctuate with every change in content. The <strong>Dream Mirror</strong> allows you to piece together different <strong>places</strong>, <strong>beings</strong>, <strong>objects</strong>, and <strong>emotions</strong> to create a dream scene alongside possible definitions to what these elements mean or symbolize within the dream space.<br><br>

                After visiting a category above, you will be met with a canvas depicting a location alongside options to add a being, an object, and an emotion into the scene. This will display them within the canvas, and their possible meanings will be populated below. Piecing these together alongside your own context, this could illustrate a broader meaning of your dream and could give insight into the deeper connotations of your unconscious mind.<br><br>

                Dreams will never be fully understood for everyone, but through the clues and interpretations of the elements of one’s dream, piecing them together could potentially help them reach either a medium of thought or a level of understanding of both themselves and their unconscious mind.</p><br><br><br>
                
                <p>Between dreams and reality, there are many different places with different connotations.</p><br>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Domestic Locations</h2>
                        <p>Our homes or places in which we reside in within reality. The dream world often connects the concept of home to our core values and existence as individuals, meaning that these locations typically represent ourselves</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Essential Locations</h2>
                        <p>Hospitals, schools, stores, and other necessary places we must visit at some point or another in our lives. In the dream world, these places bear some level of response to our lives in a broader sense</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Occupational Locations</h2>
                        <p>In reality, these would be our workplaces or the locations in which we carry out our jobs or hobbies. These can live in the dream world similarly to how essential locations do, however they can also represent our minds on a mechanical level</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Entertaining Locations</h2>
                        <p>Hospitals, schools, stores, and other necessary places we must visit at some point or another in our lives. In the dream world, these places bear some level of response to our lives in a broader sense</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Use these as your starting point, as your mindset moving through this experience. You will discover new ways of looking at your dreams by defining the setting, its objects, beings, emotions, and concepts, and using that as your launching point of interpretation. Once you put everything together, you might begin to learn a little more about yourself through the potential signs and symbols your unconscious mind grants you every night.</p><br>
                
                <p>Keep in mind that none of the settings or symbols that will be explored are, nor should they try to be, stark and constant definitions of one's dream experiences. Every person is unique, and each and every person has their own experiences, opinions, outlooks, and personalities that can influence their dreams. Thus, it is impossible to assume, let alone create something that can calculate, one's exact dream scenarios and their projected meanings. This place exists to house collections of departure points, or tools, for an individual's thought process in deciphering their dreams. The best person to decipher an individual is the individual themselves, and all they need are the tools to do it.</p>
