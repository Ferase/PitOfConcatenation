                <p>Many believe dreams to be a cavalcade of nonsensical imagery and sound we experience when we sleep. To a degree, this can be truthful for a fraction of these nighttime experiences, however, dreams themselves share a connection with our thoughts, feelings, and of course, our imagination.<br><br>

                Have you ever had a time in your life where you were stressed, and within your dreams, you experienced something frightening? When weâ€™re stressed, we can feel mixtures of fear, sadness, anger, or restlessness, and within our dreams, any one of these emotions can take hold and project an environment that, itself, embodies this emotion. This manifestation of the state of the conscious mind within the unconscious mind reveals some level of potential connection between the two.<br><br>

                The bond between the waking and sleeping mind defines expression of related feelings between both states, creating the opportunity for these adventures in our minds to be a more loose, almost allegorical manifestation of our perspectives. In essence, a dream may be more than the nonsense some believe it to be. Rather, it may be a coded yet significant set of circumstances that hold more meaning than one may be led to think.<br><br>

                These ideas are what led to the inception of the Dream Mirror, a resource for users to search and contextualize their dream symbols with each other and give them the tools to help them interpret their dreams. While the Dream Mirror contains information about each symbol and aims to create a level of context for the user, its primary goal is to lay out these interpretations as a resource for others to then concatenate with their minds, thought processes, and experiences. Dreams are a very personal form of self-reflection, and thus, conclusions should only be made by the dreamer themselves. The Dream Mirror stands as a tool, a mindset, that can help others critically think about their dream experiences and how they could potentially reflect to them on a deeper level.</p>
