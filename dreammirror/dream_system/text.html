    <!-- Places -->
    <h3 id="heading_place">Place</h3>
    
    <div id="place_1">
        <h4>Home</h4>
        <p><strong>Home</strong> is a representation of oneself. Our homes are where we find our families, our possessions, our memories, and so much more that directly connects back to ourselves</p>
    </div>

    <div id="place_2">
        <h4>School</h4>
        <p><strong>Schools</strong> are a place that represents one’s past and potential future, as a school in reality is where one goes to grow and develop themselves. In a dream, the setting of a school may denote that you are growing in your knowledge or maturity, though it could also mean that you feel you need to grow and mature further from how you are now</p>
    </div>

    <div id="place_3">
        <h4>Office</h4>
        <p>The <strong>office</strong> is a rather often stereotyped location, as whenever anyone imagines one, they typically connect the location to the sttandard idea of work. Offices are also seen as orderly, intricate webs of people, acting as parts for a larger body. Thus, finding yourself within an office inside a dream usually denotes that you are trying to solve a problem going on in your waking life, and the reason this concept may manifest as an office is likely because of your way of thinking, which in this case would likely need to be analytical or logical</p>
    </div>

    <div id="place_4">
        <h4>Hotel</h4>
        <p>A <strong>hotel</strong> serves as a temporary living space, a place where one stays either as a transition from one location to another or as a residence for a short period. In the dream world, any form of residence is often considered a representation of oneself, and as such, a temporary dwelling may be a sign that you feel uncomfortable in a current living situation or lifestyle. It could also be something as simple as a form of acknowledgement that you’re in a transitory point in your life</p>
    </div>

    <div id="place_5">
        <h4>Hospital</h4>
        <p>All places carry different meanings to different people, and <strong>hospitals</strong> are likely among the most prominent of this archetype. Some may see them as safe havens, and others may have bad memories associated with them. These drastically different viewpoints may very well change the potential meaning of a hospital in a specific person’s dream. If you see them as locations where bad memories were made, you might be viewing something recent as something you want to repress, and it could very likely relate closely to an experience you’ve had at a hospital. On the other hand, if you view hospitals as safe places to heal, you could be acknowledging that you are healing from something, be it physically or mentally, and that you are making some form of progress in doing so</p>
    </div>

    <div id="place_6">
        <h4>Fair</h4>
        <p>People go to <strong>fairs</strong> to escape reality and enjoy the attractions, characters, and lore within them. If you find yourself in a fair or theme park within your dreams, you might be manifesting such a joyous location out of a desire to escape Incidentally, if you dream that you’re within the restricted areas of a theme park, this could point to unexpressed rebellious feelings which you either repress or don’t know you have</p>
    </div>

    <div id="place_7">
        <h4>Hallways</h4>
        <p>In and of themselves, <strong>hallways</strong> are links and transitions between other more focused and purposed spaces. Within the dream world, they often serve a near equal objective as a transitionary tool but instead as a reflection of the dreamer’s state of being. It’s common for those whose dreams prevalently contain hallways to be in a transitional period in their lives. While the magnitude of such events are subjective and situational, some examples of these changes are moving house, breaking habits, and choosing alternate paths in life</p>
    </div>

    <div id="place_8">
        <h4>Grocery Store</h4>
        <p>We’ve all been to a <strong>grocery store</strong>, whether it’s to restock our shelves for a time or to get materials to prepare something specific. Whatever it may be, these places serve as locations to find necessary resources to use in something larger. If you find yourself in a grocery store within your dream, your mind may be manifesting it as a representation of something you’re preparing for, or possibly something you’re looking to find a solution or answer to</p>
    </div>

    <div id="place_9">
        <h4>Theater</h4>
        <p>From stage plays to giant silver screen films, the <strong>theater</strong> is a place of storytelling, expression, and especially togetherness between those experiencing the performances and actions onstage or onscreen. If you spot a theater or find yourself within one in a dream, it likely has some level of connection to your community and its social contract. You could be recognizing your place within your community, as if you find yourself as part of the crowd, you could be viewing yourself as having been integrated into your community</p>
    </div>

    <div id="place_10">
        <h4>Jail</h4>
        <p>In reality, a <strong>jail or prison</strong> is a place where criminals and people guilty of breaking the law go to serve their time for whatever they had done. Additionally, and on a more intrinsic level, jails serve as a means of barring those within from their freedom; a shackle holding them back. Most dreams wherein a jail or similar location is the setting usually revolve around this idea, symbolizing the idea that the dreamer might be being restrained by something in their life and is therefore unable to be completely free</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Beings -->
    <h3 id="heading_being">Being</h3>
    
    <div id="being_1">
        <h4>Person</h4>
        <p>If you encounter <strong>people</strong> you know within your dream, it could have a connection to your relationship with that person or your recognition of their identity. On the other hand, manifesting random people in your dreams is quite common, and usually an effect of your mind creating a familiar copy of reality</p>
    </div>

    <div id="being_2">
        <h4>Cat</h4>
        <p><strong>Cats</strong> are an embodiment of the love for the feminine principle, and within a dream, they typically stand to represent its values. A cat in one’s dream can denote a sense of calmness and creativity, symbolizing patient feelings and a softspoken nature. Their association with hunting may also symbolize a desire for discovery or freedom</p>
    </div>

    <div id="being_3">
        <h4>Dog</h4>
        <p>As man’s best friend, <strong>dogs</strong> represent loyalty, affection, and happiness within a dream. They also embody a strong love of the masculine principle, and therefore, the symbol of the dog has a strong tie to your overall sense of love. Thus, the actions the dog is performing may denote how you feel or express your love and affection towards others</p>
    </div>

    <div id="being_4">
        <h4>Bird</h4>
        <p>When anyone thinks of a <strong>bird</strong>, they immediately gravitate towards the concept of flight. In the dream world, this could directly connect to the ideas of freedom and discovery through such a concept, however birds can sometimes exist as messengers. More specifically, in this scenario, they typically symbolize a piece of information you haven’t fully processed or may not completely understand yet</p>
    </div>

    <div id="being_5">
        <h4>Lion</h4>
        <p><strong>Lions</strong> are ferocious animals, seen by most as the absolute apex of the apex predators. Encountering such a beast within your dream usually symbolizes a kind of power or strength, particularly related to one’s confidence or empowerment. A lion could also represent an epiphany or greater understanding of a subject that is within your reach</p>
    </div>

    <div id="being_6">
        <h4>Deer</h4>
        <p>A <strong>deer</strong> is an animal commonly seen as evasive or reticent, making them somewhat of enigmatic characters both in the waking and dreaming worlds. Spotting this being within a dream could mean that you hold yourself steady as a guardian towards yourself or others, and as such, it may be a symbol of your own path of self-understanding</p>
    </div>

    <div id="being_7">
        <h4>Turtle</h4>
        <p>The concept of patience is often related to <strong>turtles</strong> and similar testudines, as they are known for their slow yet steady speed. If you happen to spy a turtle within your dream, it may be a more literal symbol of your own patience and the perseverance that accompanies it</p>
    </div>

    <div id="being_8">
        <h4>Insect</h4>
        <p>Many people have a fear of <strong>insects</strong>, whether it be spiders, flies, bees, or others. They are so different from us in size, shape, sound, environment, and overall build and function, and thus, we often have some kind of aversion towards them. If you find any within your dreams, it likely has a close connection to a fear of some kind, possibly even something irrational or uncertain to even your waking mind</p>
    </div>

    <div id="being_9">
        <h4>Mouse</h4>
        <p><strong>Mice</strong> are a fearful sight for some; however, the core idea of a mouse doesn’t necessarily reside in fear, at least for most. A mouse can symbolize something that’s hidden, something that is omnipresent but isn’t out in the open. Dreams tend to hold symbols that are reflections of the self or interpretations of the world, so this “something” may be a subliminal idea or observation that connects to a larger picture</p>
    </div>

    <div id="being_10">
        <h4>Ghost</h4>
        <p>Through the scope of commonly shared beliefs of the modern day, <strong>ghosts</strong> are or would be some kind of manifestation within the real world of a being that has died. When diving deeper into the concept itself however, a ghost is inherently an embodiment of what once was; an homage to something whose status has changed from what they once were. Seeing a ghost or ghostly figure might link to something former, be it an idea, memory, or even another being</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Objects -->
    <h3 id="heading_obj">Object</h3>
    
    <div id="obj_1">
        <h4>Flower</h4>
        <p>Across many cultures, <strong>flowers</strong> stand as a symbol of love or respect, and the same is true for dreams. If a flower is significant or memorable within a dream, its likely that it connects to some form of love or affection the person has towards something or someone. Additionally, its prevalence may be speaking as commentary to someone or something you love, or it could be a response to your overall view on love itself</p>
    </div>

    <div id="obj_2">
        <h4>Book</h4>
        <p><strong>Books</strong> are the embodiment of knowledge, and thus, they live as a symbol for information and definition. The prevalence of books within one’s dream potentially connects to the idea that bits of information that could possibly answer a question your conscious mind has been pondering already exist within your knowledge</p>
    </div>

    <div id="obj_3">
        <h4>Clock</h4>
        <p>Being messengers of time, <strong>clocks</strong> are the indicator for movement, progression, growth, age, decay, and countless other processes. If you focus on your time in real life and find yourself dreaming about clocks, it’s likely your habits of always watching the time are simply firing off like muscle memory within your dreams. If time isn’t a big focus in your everyday life, it could be the embodiment of an anxiety or fear that you either don’t fully think about in your waking hours or something that you aim a lot of your focus towards which consumes your time or has strict deadlines</p>
    </div>

    <div id="obj_4">
        <h4>Lamp</h4>
        <p>In general, <strong>lights and lamps</strong> are symbols of problem-solving, ideas, innovation, and of course, clarity. The goal of any light is to make clear and visible a place or an object that cannot be seen in normal conditions, and within a dream, this could be a sign of mental discovery or even epiphany towards an idea, just like a light at the end of a tunnel</p>
    </div>

    <div id="obj_5">
        <h4>Chair</h4>
        <p><strong>Chairs</strong> are things a lot of us find ourselves sitting down in when we want to work, relax, or do anything in between. Regarding only the presence of a chair in a dream, it can represent a commitment or pledge, and depending on the environment the chair is in, this implied vow could mean many possible things. If you actually sat in the chair, this could mean that you’ve taken the pledge it represents, and you’ve planted yourself there to initiate the commitment</p>
    </div>

    <div id="obj_6">
        <h4>Phone</h4>
        <p>Truth be told, the concept of a <strong>phone</strong> has been tugged in countless directions within roughly the past decade, given the rise of the smartphone. The phone itself can be a symbol of connection between one, more, or all people, whereas something like a smartphone may be more often perceived as somewhat of the direct opposite given today’s phone and social media culture and its impact onto social links outside of the internet. Should one be a memorable piece of a dream, it could symbolize either of the aforementioned or even something else. All potential meanings for anything in any individual’s dreams should be reflected upon to better determine their clearest connotations, and this rule applies to this item far more </p>
    </div>

    <div id="obj_7">
        <h4>Food</h4>
        <p><strong>Food</strong> is a core principle of life; in order to live, we must eat. As a symbol of sustainment of oneself, food often shares this meaning within a dream to a degree. Despite this, if it is a significant symbol within your dream, it might be a reflection upon what you eat rather than generally why you eat. Some tend to see food as something they must control or mediate, and this could very well play into it as a dream symbol</p>
    </div>

    <div id="obj_8">
        <h4>Drink</h4>
        <p><strong>Drinking</strong> is a core principle of life, as few creatures can survive for long without them. Although drinks can represent this form of sustenance, most often connect drinks to that of alcoholic beverages rather than the concept itself. Alcohol is an addictive substance, and while most understand this, it is often related to the ideas of fun and celebration. If this form of drinking appears within one’s dream, it could be linking to the idea of equilibrium in ones life or mediation between two or more things</p>
    </div>

    <div id="obj_9">
        <h4>Car</h4>
        <p>Today, most general travel is done by <strong>car</strong>. In a way, the car is the medium by which most all people traverse their lives from day to day. Given this association with the journey of life, a car may well symbolize one’s life path in some way, and it could possibly stand as the symbol of the person themselves in a certain point along this journey</p>
    </div>

    <div id="obj_10">
        <h4>Mirror</h4>
        <p>A <strong>mirror</strong> is an item that reflects everything around it, revealing everything it sees within its image. They are the epitome of representation and impression, as they merely project existences that they view in the real world. A mirror may act as a call for reflection and contemplation, as within a dream, looking through a mirror will show what it sees, and its true and individual symbolism may only be clear once you’ve deciphered what it has showed you</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Feelings -->
    <h3 id="heading_feel">Emotion</h3>
    
    <div id="feel_1">
        <h4>Happiness</h4>
        <p>Within a dream, <strong>joy and happiness</strong> are powerful feelings that only show their true forms when one experiences something truly remarkable, mesmerizing, or meaningful to them. Feeling happy in a dream, or awakening to a feeling of happiness, most likely means that your dream experience was reminiscing something joyful that happened in the past, or possibly creating a scenario that derives from such an experience</p>
    </div>

    <div id="feel_2">
        <h4>Sadeness</h4>
        <p><strong>Sadness</strong> is an emotion many relate to negative events, and while there is a true connection between sadness and negativity, this emotion can also erupt from a sense of closure or departure from something sentimentally or chronically habitual. Feeling sad within your dreams may mean that your unconscious mind is simulating or encoding the occurrence of a worry into your dream experience, or it could also mean that your mind has started to cope with something and has begun the process of closure</p>
    </div>

    <div id="feel_3">
        <h4>Anger</h4>
        <p>As a very powerful and dangerous emotion, <strong>anger</strong> represents negativity, frustration, and impatience towards something. Feeling this emotion in your dreams could mean that your mind undertones your dreams with something that’s bothering or frustrating you in real life. This emotion often carries over from days where you might have had a bad experience or an emotional shock</p>
    </div>

    <div id="feel_4">
        <h4>Fear</h4>
        <p>The feeling of being <strong>afraid</strong> is one of the most deeply rooted emotions in nearly all creatures, especially humans. Expressing fear in a dream often stems from an actual fear or phobia one has, and can often manifest itself as a creature or person that chases you within your dream. This emotion usually conveys the idea that you are putting something off or avoiding something that you either generally fear or something that needs more immediate attention</p>
    </div>

    <div id="feel_5">
        <h4>Anxiety</h4>
        <p><strong>Anxiety</strong> is the ultimate embodiment of stress and chaos, standing to represent an imbalance of one’s emotional or mental state through a cavalcade of other emotions and actions. Responding to anything within a dream with feelings of anxiety can represent a loss of control over something, either within yourself or something in real life</p>
    </div>
